# 🚀 Ansh Panchtilak: Interactive Product Portfolio

This project is an interactive, single-page portfolio application designed to showcase my technical skills, product mindset, and quantitative impact in a dynamic dashboard format, simulating a real-world BI tool.

## ✨ Core Concept & Philosophy

The portfolio moves beyond a static resume by presenting data through an interactive dashboard layout. This choice reflects a strategic understanding of product management by focusing on **user experience (UX)** and making **metrics-driven information** easily digestible.

| Section | Goal | Visualization Method |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Experience** | Showcase Quantitative Impact | Doughnut Charts (for % change) |
| **Skills** | Define Competency Balance | Radar Chart (for profile shape) |
| **Projects** | Demonstrate Strategic Depth | Interactive Toggle (Product vs. Tech View) |

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

* **HTML5 & JavaScript (Vanilla):** Core structure and all dynamic, client-side routing logic.
* **Tailwind CSS:** Used for utility-first styling, ensuring a clean, modern, and fully responsive user interface.
* **Chart.js:** Utilized for data visualization (Doughnut and Radar charts).

## 💡 Key Features & Interactivity

### 1. Product/Tech View Toggle
In the **Projects & Strategy** section, each project card features a dynamic toggle switch:
* **Product View:** Explains the **Problem, Strategy, and Business Impact**.
* **Tech View:** Details the **Architecture, Frameworks (Python, ML, APIs), and Implementation**.
* **Benefit:** Demonstrates the ability to communicate project value effectively to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

### 2. Quantitative Impact Visualization
The **Experience & Impact** page converts achievement statements into visual metrics:
* A doughnut chart clearly illustrates the **~20% improvement in data load efficiency** via API integration.
* A separate chart highlights the **~30% reduction in UI bugs** achieved through code refactoring/debugging.

### 3. Competency Matrix
The **Skills** page uses a Radar Chart to map a balanced profile across six core domains:
* `Product Strategy`
* `AI/ML & Data`
* `Frontend/UX`
* `Backend/API`
* `Cloud/DevOps`
* `Agile/Process`

This visual summary quickly conveys the breadth of technical and strategic capabilities required for a Product Management role.

## 🎨 Design & Accessibility

* **Color Palette:** Warm Neutrals (`#F9F8F6`, `#333`) with Terracotta (`#C66B3D`) and Teal (`#4A7C78`) accents for a professional, inviting look.
* **Responsiveness:** Utilizes Tailwind breakpoints to ensure a consistent experience across desktop (sidebar) and mobile (collapsible menu).
